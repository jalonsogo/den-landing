Marketing landing page for **den**, the app for [Docker Sandboxes](https://docs.docker.com/ai/sandboxes/).
den gives every coding agent a sandbox of its own — a private microVM with its own
filesystem, daemon, and guarded network — so it can build, install, and rewrite
freely while your machine never stirs. This is a single static page with a warm
"paper" aesthetic, a light/dark theme, and live embeds of the real den UI.

## Preview

## Highlights

- **Light / dark theme** — toggle in the nav; persists to `localStorage` and respects the OS preference. Applied before first paint to avoid a flash.
- **Interactive 3D map** — a topographic "den country" (Three.js) of live sandboxes you can drag/pan; click a dot for a detail card. Fog and cards recolor per theme.
- **Live product embeds** — the real den UI (`den-ui.html`) is embedded and cropped to show:
  - the **sandbox list** (with a cursor tapping "＋ new sandbox"),
  - the **network policy** panel (with a looping "add rule" animation),
  - a **kit's capabilities** (Remote MCPs, network, env vars, agent memory).
  These stay in sync with the site theme.
- **Shuffling hero art** — click the hero pill to fade in a random header from `resources/headers/`. Drop any image into that folder and it's picked up automatically when served over HTTP.
- **FAQ** — plain-English accordions (one open at a time) summarized from the docs, each linking to the relevant page.
- **Download buttons** — resolve to the latest GitHub release for the visitor's OS (`.dmg` / `.exe`) via the GitHub API, falling back to the releases page.
- **Responsive** — mobile hamburger nav and a shorter hero mockup on small screens.

## Getting started

Static site, no build step. It relies on `fetch`/iframes, so **serve it over HTTP**
(some features — the header folder-listing, the live embeds — don't work from a
raw `file://` open):

```bash
python3 -m http.server 8000
# then visit http://localhost:8000
```
